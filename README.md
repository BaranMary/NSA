### Autistic cultures
Please check this video by Marrok Sedgwick:
"Autistic culture and the medical perspective of autism are at odds. The gold standard interventions for autism lauded by medical and educational professionals alike is considered abusive by the autistic community. People Like Me allows nonspeaking autistic people to speak out against the intervention that seeks to make them normal, and declare their pride in being members of a community and culture that sees autism as a natural and just part of human diversity. This version is open captioned. For audio descriptions, please choose the link called People Like Me (2019) AD."
